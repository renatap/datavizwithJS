<h1>Depression and Anxiety Around the World</h1>
<div class="description">
    <p>
    In a survey conducted in 2020 by Welcome Global Monitor, respondents were asked: 'Have you ever been so anxious or depressed that you could not continue your regular daily activities as you normally would for two weeks or longer?' 
    <br><br>Each star in this visualisation represents one of the top 40 countries according to the share of the sample who answered yes to the question above.
    Also shown are the population size and the share of people who reported feeling either ‘very comfortable’ or ‘somewhat comfortable’ speaking about these issues with someone they know. </p>
